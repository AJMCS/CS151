ALGORITHM 01
purpose: Algorithm to calculate change from a vending machine with least number of coins.

input: price of item, amount paid
output: number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies


Step 1: Calculate the change due by taking the amount paid and subtracting the price of the item.

Step 2: Calculate the number of maximum number of quarters that can be used to make the change by
using the modulus operator of 25 on the change due. 

Step 3: Save the remainder of the change due after the quarters have been calculatedas the new value of change due.

Step 4: Repeat steps 2-3 for dimes, nickels (where dimes you use modulus of 10 and nickels you use modulus of 5).
The remainder of the change due after the dimes and nickels have been calculated will be the number of pennies.

Step 5: Output the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
