31. A derived class inherits all data members and all functions of its base class.     

    - An outside class (not a child) can directly access public data members and public functions of another class.     
    

34. In the following line of code, the class's access specification to the base class is  (or is equivalent to)  public .
  ```
  class Pet : public Dog  
  ```
 
35.In the following line of code, the class's access specification to the base class is (or is equivalent to)  private .
  ```
  class Pet : Fish  
  ```
 
36. Protected members of the base class are like private members, except they may be accessed by derived class functions.

37. In a base class with a private access modifier, if a base class member is public / protected / private, then access to it 
by a derived class becomes private / private / inaccessible.

38. In a base class with a protected access modifier, if a base class member is public / protected / private, then access to 
it by a derived class becomes protected / protected / inaccessible.

39. In a base class with a public access modifier, if a base class member is public / protected / private, then access to it 
by a derived class becomes public / protected / inaccessible.

40. When both a base class and a derived class have constructors, the base class constructor is run first.

41. When both a base class and a derived class have destructors, the derived class destructor is run first.

42. An overridden base class function may be called by a function in the derived class by using the scope resolution "::" operator.
