2. The  try  block should enclose code that directly or indirectly might cause an exception to be thrown.

4. When writing function or class templates, you use a(n)  template parameter  to specify a generic data type.

7. Containers (data structures) which organize data in a successive and continuous fashion similar to an 
array or a list are known as sequential containers.

8. Containers (data structures) which use keys to access elements such as a set or map are known as associative containers.

12. Write a function template that is capable of adding any two numeric values of the same data type and 
returning the result.

```
template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
