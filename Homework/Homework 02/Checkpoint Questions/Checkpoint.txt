10.2  Write a statement defining a variable named  dPtr.  The variable should be a pointer to a  double.

    double* dPtr;


10.3  List three uses of the  *  symbol in C++.

    1. To declare a pointer
    2. To dereference a pointer
    3. Multiplication operator


10.4  What is the output of the following program?

    The output will be: 350 5 25


10.5  Rewrite the following loop so it uses square bracket notation (with  [  and  ] ) instead of the indirection operator.

    for (int x = 0; x < 30; x++)
    cout << array[x] << endl;

10.6  Assume  ptr  is a pointer to an  int  and holds the memory address (decimal)  4950.  On a system with 4-byte integers, 
what address will be in  ptr  (in decimal) after the following statement?

    Statement: ptr += 12;

    12 * 4 = 48
    4950 + 48 = 4998

    The address will be 4998.


10.7  Assume  ptrInt  is a pointer to an  int,  and  ptrDouble  is a pointer to a  double.  Both have previously been 
assigned values.  For each of the following statements, determine whether the statement is valid or invalid.  For those 
that are invalid, explain why.

    a) Valid cause it increments the pointer to the next int in memory.
    b) Valid. It decrements the pointer to the previous int in memory.
    c) Invalid. The pointers are different data types so you cannot subtract them.
    d) Invalid. The pointers are different data types so you cannot add them.
    e) Valid. x is an int so the variable and pointer have the same data type and can be incrememented.
    f) Invalid. pointer arithmetic only involves addition and subtraction, you cannot multiply or divide pointers.


34. Consider the function:
  void modify(int &x) {  
      x = 10 ; 
  } 
 
Show how to call the  modify  function so that it sets the integer defined below to 10 in the calling function:
 
  int i ;
  <call "modify" function to set i to 10> 

answer:

  int i;
  modify(i);
