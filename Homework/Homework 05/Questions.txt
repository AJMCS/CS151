Most of these questions are taken from Chapter 11 of our textbook:

Suppose that class Y is a friend of class X, meaning that the member functions of class Y have access to all members of class X.  Should the  friend  keyword appear in class Y's declaration or in class X's declaration?
    Answer: Yes it should.

4.Static member variables are initialized to values  ______  the class.     (where?)
    Answer: Outside

5.A static member variable may be called  ______  any instances of the class are defined.     (when?)
    Answer: Before

6.A(n)  __________  tells the compiler that a class or structure with a specified name will be defined later in the program.
    Answer: Forward declaration

18.Consider the following class declaration:
```
  class Thing { 
      private: 
          int x ; 
          int y ; 
          static int z ; 
      public: 
          Thing(())
              { x = y = z ; } 
          static void putThing(int a)   
              { z = a ; } 
  } ; ;
  int Thing::z = 0 ; 
  ```
 
Assume a program using the class declaration above creates three separate  Thing  objects and does nothing else: 

    a. How many separate instances of the  x  member exist?
        Answer: 3
    b. How many separate instances of the  y  member exist ?
        Answer: 3
    c. How many separate instances of the  z  member exist?
        Answer: 1
    d. What numeric values will be stored in the  x  and  y  members of each object, or are they undefined?
        Answer: 0
    e. Write a statement that would call the  putThing  member function before any  Thing  objects are created.
        Answer: Thing::putThing(0);
