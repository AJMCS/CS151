```
Bird& operator=(const Bird& other);
```

26. Assume a class named  Yen  exists.  Write the header for a member function that overloads the  <  operator for that class.
```
bool operator<(const Yen& other) const;
```

28. Assume a class named  Team  exists which contains a sequence of  Player  objects.  Write the header for a member function 
that overloads the square brackets  [  ]  operator for that class which returns a single  Player  as a specified position 
in the sequence.  (Bounds checking is not required.)
```
Player& operator[](int index);
