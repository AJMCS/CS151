ALGORITHM 04
purpose: Algorithm to calculate Pi using the infinite series until a certain degree of accuracy is reached.

input: degree of accuracy
output: approximation of Pi


Step 1: Initialize the approximation of Pi to 0.

Step 2: Use the general formula for the infinite series to calculate Pi [Pi/4 = SUM((-1)^n / (2n + 1)) from n = 0 to infinity].

Note:The bounds of the summation are given by the degree of accuracy. So we will write a while loop that will continue to add terms to the summation
until the absolute value of the difference between the current term and the previous term is less than the degree of accuracy.

Step 3: Add an additional term to the approximation of Pi.

Step 4: Check if the absolute value of the difference between the current approximation and the previous approximation is less than the degree of accuracy.
If it is, return the current approximation.

Step 4: If it is not, repeat steps 3 and 4.

Step 5: Return the approximation of Pi.
