Assignment: Homework 01 - Questions.

8. If a numeric array is partially initialized, the uninitialized elements will be set to zero.

20. When you pass the name of an array as an argument to a function, you are actually passing a 
pointer to the first element of the array.

22. Given the following array definition:

  ```int values[5] = {4,7,6, 8, 2 }; ```

The code below displays: 2 14 7

  ```cout << values[4] << "  "<< (values[2] + values[3]) << "  " << ++values[1] << endl;```

32. The arrays  array1  and  array2  each hold 25 integer elements.  The following code is designed 
to show the total the values in each of two arrays array1  and  array2.  Will the code print the 
correct total for each array?  Explain why or why not.  You can assume that the values of  array1  
and  array2  have been initialized.

  ```*didn't bother to copy it*```

The answer is no. The reason being is that there is a scope issue with the variable called total. 
Since total exists outside of either of the for-loops the data collected from the furst for-loop 
will persist even after its done executing. by the time the second for loop is done, what is 
printed to the console will be the sum of both array2 and array1, not array2 by itself. 

To fix this issue, you would need to either create seperate variables for each for-loop or you would 
need to zero-out the existing total variable to begin counting from scratch.
