ALGORITHM 03
purpose: Algorithm which determines if two strings are anagrams of each other.

input: two strings
output: true if the strings are anagrams, false otherwise


Step 1: Check if the two strings are the same length. If they are not, return false.

Step 2: Clean the strings by removing all non-alphabetic characters and converting them to lowercase.
This can be accomplished by using the replace() function in the algorithm library to remove all
non-alphabetic characters and the lower() function to convert the characters to lowercase.

Step 3: Compare the sorted strings. If they are the same, return true. Otherwise, return false.
