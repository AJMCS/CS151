ALGORITHM 02
purpose: An algorithm to determine the average amount of weight of all horses in the stable, 
as well as the name and weight of the heaviest and lightest horse.

input: name and weight of each horse in the stable
output: average weight of all horses, name and weight of heaviest horse, name and weight of lightest horse


Step 1: Initialize variables for the total weight, the number of horses, the heaviest horse, and the lightest horse.
Initialze the name and weight of the heaviest horse and the lightest horse to the first horse in the stable.

Step 2: For each horse in the stable, add the weight to the total weight and increment the number of horses. Also,
check if the current horse is heavier than the heaviest horse or lighter than the lightest horse. If either is true,
update the name and weight of the heaviest/lightest horse to the current horse.

Step 3: After you have gone through all the horses, calculate the average weight of all horses by dividing the total
weight by the number of horses.

Step 4: Output the average weight of all horses, the name and weight of the heaviest horse, and the name and weight
of the lightest horse.
