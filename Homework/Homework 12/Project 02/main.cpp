/* main.cpp â€“ Demonstrates AbstractSeq with even and factorial sequences.
* Author: AJ McDaniel
* Module: 12
* Project 02: Sequence Sum
* Problem statement: This program uses an abstract base class to represent two different sequences of numbers
* and then prints terms and calculates the sum of terms in each sequence.
*
* Algorithm:
* 1. Create instances of EvenSequence and FactorialSequence.
2. Call printSeq(3, 12) on EvenSequence and display its sum from 7 to 10.
3. Call printSeq(1, 10) on FactorialSequence and display its sum from 4 to 6.
4. All output should label values of n and fun(n) and clearly state the summed ranges.
