Homework 12 Questions:

2. A member function of a base class which is not completely implemented (only the function header is provided) 
so that all concrete descendant classes must implement that function is called a(n) abstract function.

4. To use dynamic binding, a member function of a class needs to be declared as a(n) virtual function.

6. Dynamic binding takes place at run time.

8. An object referenced by a base class pointer needs to be cast to be assigned to a derived class pointer.

13. The keyword final prevents a member function from being overridden in a descendant class.

14. To have the compiler check that a member function in a child overrides a virtual member function in the 
parent, you should use the keyword override after the function declaration in the child class.

15. No, it will not because Animal is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated.

16. Yes, it will because Cat is a concrete child class derived from Animal, and a pointer to Animal 
can point to a Cat object.

17. Yes, it will for the same reason the Cat object will compile

18. No, because you cannot instantiate an abstract class.
