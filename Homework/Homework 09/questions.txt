Homework 9 Questions:

4. The fstream header file is required for file I/O operations.
5. The three file stream data types are ifstream, ofstream, and fstream.
8. The fstream file stream data type is for output files, input files, and files that perform both input and output.
18. The eof member function reports when the end of a file has been reached.
22. Binary files which contain data that is unformatted and not necessarily stored as ASCII text.
26. The write member function writes "raw" binary data to a file.

39. Pseudocode for determining the number of bytes in a file:
```
Open the file for reading
Set byteCount = 0
While not end of file:
    Read a block of N bytes from the file (N is a reasonable buffer size, e.g., 1024)
    If less than N bytes are read, add the number of bytes read to byteCount and break
    Else, add N to byteCount
Close the file
Return byteCount
```

40. Pseudocode for comparing two binary files for identical contents:
```
Open file1 and file2 for reading
While neither file has reached end:
    Read a block of N bytes from file1
    Read a block of N bytes from file2
    If the number of bytes read from file1 != number from file2, files are different
    Compare the bytes read from both files
    If any byte differs, files are different
If both files reach end at the same time, files are identical
Else, files are different
Close both files
```

41. Pseudocode for reversing the content of one file into another:
```
Open source file for reading
Open destination file for writing
Determine the size of the source file by reading through it and counting bytes
Let fileSize = total number of bytes
Set buffer size N (as much as memory allows)
For position = fileSize - N down to 0, step -N:
    Seek to position in source file
    Read up to N bytes or only remaining bytes if less than N remain
    Write these bytes in reverse order to the destination file
If any bytes remain at the start,
    Seek to start, read remaining bytes, write them in reverse order
Close both files
```
